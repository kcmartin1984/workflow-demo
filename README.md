A demo project showcasing **Python + GitHub Actions** for automated reporting and quota monitoring.  
This repository is designed as a portfolio example to demonstrate workflow automation, error handling, and reporting logic.

## üöÄ Features
- **Automated Weekly Report**  
  - Runs every Monday 09:00 UTC via GitHub Actions  
  - Can also be triggered manually  

- **Python Reporting Script**  
  - Generates a weekly summary (Meetings, Chats, OneDrive activity)  
  - Includes quota monitoring with configurable threshold  
  - Built-in error handling and fallback logic  

- **Sample Data**  
  - `src/sample_data.json` provides demo values for report output  
  - Safe to publish (no secrets included)  

- **Environment Variables**  
  - `.env.example` shows how to override quota threshold  
  - Real `.env` is ignored by `.gitignore`
